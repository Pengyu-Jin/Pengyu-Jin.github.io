# The secret to Nintendo's success

ANNOUNCER: NPR

[COIN SPINNING]

[THEME MUSIC]

ADRIAN MA: In the world or consumer electronics, being number one is usually an advantage. Like, if your product has the newest tech, the most features, the fastest processors, chances are, people will line up to buy it.

WAILIN WONG: Sometimes, though, it pays not to be number one. Take Nintendo. Earlier this month, it released its latest console, the Switch 2. Now, as a piece of video game machinery, the new Switch is nowhere near as powerful as its competitors, like the Sony PlayStation or the Microsoft Xbox. And yet, when the Switch 2 was released a little over a week ago--

[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

CROWD: 3, 2, 1, go.

[END PLAYBACK]

WONG: --games in New York camped out on the sidewalk outside a Nintendo store for hours just to snap one.

[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

GAMER 1: She's been here since 12:30.

GAMER 2: Oh, my god. [LAUGHS] So much longer thatn I thought.

GAMER 3: I've been here for, now, 18 days. And me and my buddy, Chris, and our Chicken Dog have been planning this for two years.

[END PLAYBACK]

MA: Chicken Dog is such a great name.

WONG: [LAUGHS]

MA: Anyway, despite the hype around this new product, today's episode is not about the Switch 2, because we think that the story of Nintendo itself is a lot more interesting.

[MUSIC PLAYING]

MA: This is The Indicator from Planet Money. I'm Adrian Ma.

WONG: (IMITATING MARIO) And it's-a me, Wailin Wong.

MA: [LAUGHS]

WONG: Today on the show, the business strategy that transformed Nintendo from a tiny Janpanese toy company to a global brand that includes games and movies and even theme parks.

MA: And how Nintendo reinvented the video game industry by not being number one.

WONG: The story of Nintendo begins long before the invention of video games. In 1889, a guy in Kyoto, Japan named Fusajiro Yamauchi started making these things called Hanafuda cards, basically playing cards that were often used for gambling.

MA: And for several decades, playing cards are Nintendo's whole business--Hanafuda cards, Western-style playing cards, Disney-themed cards. But by the '60s and '70s, the company also branches out into making kids' toys.

WONG: Meanwhile, in the US, a new form of entertainment begins to explode in popularity-- video games.[^1]

[^1]: In **AP Style, i.e. Associated Press Stylebook** (news/media), a space follows the em dash for clarity.

[ARCADE GAME MUSIC]

WONG: At first, you have to go to an arcade to paly video games because they are these bulky, 6-foot-tall machines. But by the mid '70s, the arcade experience starts to move into the home, with companies creating the first at-home video game consoles. One console made by Atari was an especially big hit, selling hundreds of thousands of units in its first year.

MA: Joost van Dreunen is a professor at NYU, where he teaches a class on the business of video games. And he says, Atari's success caught the attention of other companies, who were like, hey, we can do that, too.

JOOST VAN DREUNEN: Companies like General Electric that come out with their own devices, you have Emerson Radio, Fairchild. You have Coleco with ColecoVision, one of the more famous ones. Bandai comes out. Mattel comes out. RCA has its own device. So you just have a host of manufacturers all creating their own version of what they think is a home console.

WONG: Some of these names, like Fairchild or Emerson Radio, you may have never heard of them. And that's because within just a few years, this booming industry would self-destruct.

[VIDEO GAME JINGLE]

MA: Yeah. By 1983, the market had become saturated with new consoles and games, a lot of which, according to Joost, were just plain bad, I mean, janky and confusing or frustrating difficult to play. And eventually, consumers just got fed up.

DREUNEN: And they walk away from it, which leads to this collapse in consumer demand and revenue. And therefore, of course, it cascades throughout the ecosystem.

MA: In less than a year, consumer spending on video games fell by some 90%. Companies lost hundreds of millions of dollars and laid off employees. And by 1985, it seemed clear that this home video game console was just another passing fad.

WONG: Then came Nintendo. See, Nintendo had been off in Japan developing its own video game devices, which, when you think about it, is sort of a natural extension of its toy business. And in October 1985, it brought its latest machine to the United States, a little gray box called the Nintendo Entertainment System, or NES.

[VIDEO GAME MUSIC]

DREUNEN: The Nintendo came to the US. People thought they were nuts. Like, this was the most counterintuitive thing to do from a business trategy perspective. Why would you run towards a burning building? And, you know-- and that's exactly what they did.

MA: But Joost says Nintendo had a plan. It entered the US with a three-pronged business strategy. One, they told retailers, listen, you don't have to pay us upfront. Just pay us when you sell a console. Two, they had a high bar for what games they would sell for NES. So only games they thought were really good would make the cut. And three-- and this sounds pretty obvious-- but they focused hard on making games fun, as opposed to frustrating for users.

DREUNEN: We're going to have magazines around this. There's going to be a Nintendo Club around this. There's going to be a hotline that you can call if you're stuck so that you don't feel like you just spent $30, $40, $60 of your money, and you're off on your own and whatever. Go figure it out.

WONG: It never occurred to me to call the hotline when I got stuck in Double Dragon.

MA: [LAUGHS]

WONG: My whole childhood could have been different.

MA: Just, like, banging your fist against the wall, throwing the--

WONG: I could have gotten some help.

MA: You're just, like, throwing the controller at the TV screen?

WONG: [LAUGHS] Well, this strategy worked, even if I did not call the hotline. The NES would go on to sell some 60 million units. With that success, Nintendo essentially hit Reset[^2] on the whole industry.

[^2]: The captical R emphasizes that this was a pivotal, defining moment-- similar to how video game consoles perform a "Reset" operation.

DREUNEN: When everybody else was walking away, Nintendo was walking towards the games industry and rebuild it.

WONG: To use business school term, Joost says Nintendo's NES found product market fit, that sweet spot where the right product meets strong consumer demand. And eventually, more companies, like Sega and Sony, would bring their own consoles to the US market. If Nintendo hadn't succeeded like it did, some argue, the video game industry as we know it today might not exist.

MA: In the decades since, Nintendo has released lots of different devices. Some were hits. Some were flops. But one thing has been consistent, Joost says. And it's that Nintendo has never been about making consoles with the best graphics or the most cutting-edge technology.

DREUNEN: And so Nintendo has never been one to compete on technology, even though the rest of the industry has. And for that reason, to differentiate itself, it's always really leaned into limitations of technology.

MA: One of the company's head game designers, named Gunpei Yokoi, called this philosophy "lateral thinking with withered technology," which, uh, sounds a little funky. But a good example of this idea in action is the Nintendo Wii.

WONG: Oh, the Wii. We still have ours.

MA: "Wii" do? I mean, you do?

WONG: [LAUGHS] Yeah, you should come over and play it sometime. Well, I don't know if it still works. We should plug it in and see. [LAUGHS] Released in 2006, the Wii was a console with simple, childlike graphics. And its controller used very old technology-- infrared beams, like the kind that come out of your TV remote. But the Wii designers repurposed this withered technology in a novel way, allowing users to play tennis or golf or boxing simply by moving their arm. And the result was a very family-friendly gaming system.

DREUNEN: You could play with anybody else in your house. I used to get my ass handed to me in Wii Tennis by my mother-in-law.

MA: [LAUGHS]

DREUNEN: But they'd managed to take a low-tech approach and make it fun for a broad range of players.

MA: Joost also says this lower tech approach meant Nintendo cound manufacture consoles for less and sell them for a lower price, so theoretically, more people will buy them.

WONG: For Nintendo fans, this sort of cheap and cheerful ethos is something that has always distinguished the brand from its competitors. That's true for jamal Michel, who writes about video games for publication like The New York Times.

JAMAL MICHEL: Without saying it, Nintendo is selling a culture.

MA: A culture that includes characters and merchandise and a whole community, but also, Jamal argues, a certain aesthetic experience.

MICHEL: The best sort of analog or comparison I could draw up would be like video game consoles to film directors. For the Xbox, I think of Michael Bay-- huge explosions and special effects and stuff like that. And Nintendo, I think the most appropriate, it's definitely Wes Anderson, from the aesthetic and the softness.

MA: [LAUGHS] Yeah, there's like a coziness to a Wes Anderson film.

MICHEL: Yeah, and I think the cozy vibe, Nintendo leans into. I don't want to consistantly have to be in a fight. And so Nintendo lets me just chill out.

MA: I think this whole episode could be summed up as, like, the business case for coziness.

WONG: I love that. And you know what? I hope Chicken Dog is feeling real cozy.
